// i dont know how to put pngs into github files like this so just follow instructions below:

// 1) look up "white circle png"

// 2) make sure that the background of the circle png is transparent. I used photopea and looked up a youtube video showing me how to do it

// 3) put picture into file called white_circle.png

// 4) repeat steps for obstacles (gray square)
