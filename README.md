# PIC-FLIP-Fluid
A particle in cell (PIC) fluid simulation combined with a fluid implicit particle (FLIP) simulation. 
I am currently working on multithreading collision detection which will hopefully speed up this project.
The simulation is able to run 10k particles at a smooth ~85 fps, as you can see in the picture below.
